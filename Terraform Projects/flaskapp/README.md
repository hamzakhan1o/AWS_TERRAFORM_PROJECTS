Project Description
This project automates the deployment of a Flask application on AWS using Terraform. It sets up the necessary AWS infrastructure, including ECS (Elastic Container Service) for container management, a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) for networking, and other required resources. The code includes Terraform configuration files to define and provision these resources consistently, enabling a scalable and repeatable deployment process for the Flask app. The ecs.sh script supports the setup and deployment tasks.
